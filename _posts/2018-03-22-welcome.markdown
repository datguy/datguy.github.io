I have enjoyed a long and successful career as a software developer, but it's time for me to refresh the basics.
I have a good understanding of enterprise software development, and I can tackle most programming challenges.
But in discussions I tend to gloss over unfamiliar terminology rather than trying to understand it.  That ends today.

I plan to refamiliarize myself with important terminology, as well as characteristics of data structures, algoriithms, and patterns.
